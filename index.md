# Why?

You find a lot of tutorials about OSGi on the web. Why add another introduction to OSGi? Well, the usual reason: they didn't really help me. I want to understand things from the ground up, and I want that ground to be as simple as possible.

All tutorials that I have found are centered around some tool that is supposed to overcome the difficulties of OSGi. But is OSGi really so difficult to master? No it isn't. You just mustn't start with complex tools. Knowing the JDK and its basic tools is quite sufficient. Of course, you should also know something about [component based software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering) because OSGi is basically about how to build and use such components in a given framework.

The examples used in this introduction are available from the [project site](https://github.com/mnlipp/osgi-getting-started) as an [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) project. I know that there are other IDEs around, but that's the one I like most. At least for the first parts of this introduction, the IDE is actually irrelevant.
