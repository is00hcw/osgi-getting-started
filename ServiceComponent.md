# From Services to Service Components

As we have seen in the previous parts, the service registry provides a a very simple and flexible mechanism to establish the relationships between the components of a software system (provided as bundles when using OSGi). The drawback of its simplicity is that it requires a relatively large effort for individual components to manage their service dependencies.

[^scratch]: A somewhat different approach to managing services is the use of "service components". The OSGi specification defines a service component as a component that "[...] contains a description that is interpreted at run time to create and dispose objects depending on the availability of other services, the need for such an object, and available configuration data. Such objects can optionally provide a service." Have a look at the cited [article](http://www-adele.imag.fr/Les.Publications/intConferences/CBSE2003Cer.pdf) that includes a nice introduction into the topic.
